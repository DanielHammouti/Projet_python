# AI resource management Logic

# 1. Monitor resource levels for shortages
# - Use the current resource levels and predefined thresholds.
# - Identify if any resource is below its threshold.

# 2. Reallocate villagers to address resource shortages
# - Find idle villagers or villagers collecting less critical resources.
# - Assign them to collect the resource in shortage.
# - Ensure villagers are directed to the closest available resource node.

# 3. Integrate into the game loop
# - Periodically check resource levels and act accordingly.
# - Address shortages by reallocating villagers.
